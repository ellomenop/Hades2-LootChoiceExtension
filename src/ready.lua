-- General strategy is to hard override the loot choices count to whatever is configured
-- Then for rewards that should not have increased choices (either config or NPC rewards),
-- just return nil instead of creating the boon button (but leave reward count at configured value)
-- Then later we have to do some additional cleanup of the UpgradeButtons table to remove the excess nils so that vow/concave stone work

-- Dictates how many loot choices game should try to show
modutil.mod.Path.Override("GetTotalLootChoices", function()
	return GetTotalLootChoices_override()
end)

-- Dictates how many loot choices game will actually show
modutil.mod.Path.Override("CalcNumLootChoices", function(isGodLoot, treatAsGodLootByShops)

-- TryUpgradeBoon Context

-- Make this a no-op in this specific context unless we set a flag, so that we can call it later in the method instead
-- This is to fix an SGG bug where the rarify animation is attached to the previous version of the button (thats destroyed) instead of the rarified one - this breaks the scaling
